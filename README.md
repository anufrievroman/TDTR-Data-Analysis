# TDTR Data Analysis
Python code that extracts the thermal conductivity from the measured decay time.
As the input file, the code uses the output of Comsol simulation of the experiment. 
Then it fits exponentially the Comsol data, determines the theoretical dependence of the thermal conductivity on the decay time. 
From this information, the code extracts the thermal conductivity from the measured decay time provided by the user.
